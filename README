csci485/Lab8 RSA encryption

Public key (121, 10677301) or (e, n)
Private key (705481, 10677301) or (d, n)

The above key pair is a valid set and will work for testing of the program.  
(Feel free to calculate your own key value pairs to experiment with)

The program works in two ways; first it will use the RSA scheme to encrypt 
simple text files, and second it will take the output of the first and reverse 
the encryption.

    1) make encode
       ./encode <filename> e n
    2) make decode
       ./decode <filename> d n

*Note: This is a simple program written to test and understand the principals 
       behind RSA encryption.  It is not intended to make important messages
       secure.
